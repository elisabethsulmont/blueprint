                <p>
                    Thinking back on the problem definition we established after conducting user observations – that being, improving human-spacial understanding and navigation – we were left with a sizable domain to explore in terms of design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our high-level model only proposed the implementation of wireless beacons to broadcast URL addresses to mobile devices in close proximity, hopefully giving the user context-appropriate directions based on their current location. We did not know what the web pages should display, how the information should be presented, or how the users would actually use or react to the technology. To investigate the idea from all angles, we used the 10-plus-10 method, generating 30 sketches total, then developed three of the most promising concepts in parallel.

                <h2 class="content-subhead">Prototypes</h2>

                <p>
                    Preliminary sketches were discussed extensively before prototyping began. Because we wished to present a number of cohesive design concepts to users for testing, we took a rather multidisciplinary approach when deciding on appropriate interfaces that could be demonstrated in accompaniment to the presentation technique itself. One of the sketches that we developed further was abandoned at this stage because it was too similar to current solutions.
                </p>

                <h4>Prototypes used in testing are listed below:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Slideshow:</b> This design feeds the user step-by-step instructions using photo-based slides depicting important landmarks and accompanied by textual directions. The motivation for this prototype was inspired by the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci"><em>memory palaces</em></a>, a mnemonic device that is often used in speed-reading. By selecting landmarks ahead of time, the user would theoretically require less mental effort to navigate through a path, because they would already have mental nodes for information retrieval. The slideshow prototype also allows users to proceed at their own pace, go back and forth between photos, or abandon navigation at any point.</p>

                            The central theme in terms of presentation was modularity, which is also an important quality measure in software development. We tried to divide the homescreen into very clear sections (see figure 10), following the manner in which we divided wayfinding into landmark-identification. Real photos were used instead of rough sketches, because testing would be impossible if users did not see lifelike images of the landmarks.

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Timelapse:</b> This design explores the effectiveness of information-dense visual exposures being used to show test subjects their full path through a high-speed timelapse. Our technique relied on an attempt to prime the user's memory by activating regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness before any actual navigation began. We selected a route from the lobby to the International Student Services office for testing.</p>

                            Here, continuity was our central focus, which served as a near-perfect complement to that presented in the Slideshow prototype. The homescreen is meant to emulate a movie reel, with clear buttons signifying 'play' functionality. Again, because testing of any value was highly dependent on the brief exposure's semblance to reality, an actual video was shown to users once they began navigation.

                <h2 class="content-subhead">Usability goals and benchmark tasks</h2>

                <p>The system's usability goals were quickly determined upon reexamination of our different audience segments. We justify the selected goals below.</p>

                <ol>
                    <b><li>The system should be <i>effective</i> as a wayfinding tool.</li></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the user is unable to navigate to their destination, the system immediately fails by not meeting the user's needs. If the user gets lost along the way or must revert back to classic navigation (i.e. maps or asking a person), the system holds no value.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b><li>The system's functionality should be immediately <i>understandable</i>.</li></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users, particularly those belonging to the Social Traveller segment, seem to have default mechanisms for wayfinding. If these users do not understand how to use the system at a glance, they will likely fall back to their old wayfinding methods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b><li>The system should be highly <i>accessible</i> to users with physical limitations.</li></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Particularly relevant to the Brown building because it houses Student Health Services, a highly accessible system is important. However, most locations in which an indoor navigation tool would be useful (museums and hospitals, for example) also require consideration to those who are handicapped.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b><li>The system should be easily <i>operable</i>.</li></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If users are too focused on their interaction with our system, it creates a potentially dangerous situation given that they could be travelling down staircases, through crowds, or along slippery hallways. From our observations, the Independent Wanderers tend to study maps and information sources; we do not want these users getting injured as a biproduct of interaction with our system.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b><li>The system should be generally <i>acceptable</i> among users.</li></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Because we believe an indoor navigation system should be transportable to different locations, low barriers to use are central to its success. The system is inherently not necessary, so users must see immediate benefit with very little effort.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>

                <h3>Test procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    We conducted tests with a total of five users. All of them were given the appropriate documentation, and each tester had to navigate using both prototypes during a single test session. As a team of three, one person was in charge of welcoming the user and getting them to fill out both the pre- and post-test questionnaires. The other team members were the test observers, one serving as the "Wizard of Oz" computer while the other took notes. Both of the test observers asked questions. In addition to the written documentation, we also recorded audio for every test subject so that we could replay certain parts of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the subjects completed the pre-test questionnaire, we showed them the training manual (poster) and asked the users what they would do if they saw such an notice. All users answered that they would pull out their phones, so we proceeded under the assumption that a poster was indeed sufficient briefing for users to understand how to access our proposed system. This was a preliminary proof of acceptability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users were then shown the landing page of the first prototype, alternating between test subjects which prototype was presented first. Users were then prompted to initiate navigation on our prototype five times, with each iteration requiring a different feature relating to one of the predefined benchmark tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After gathering further opinions, we proceeded to the actual navigating portion of our test. Starting from the entrance of the Brown building East Wing, the user was asked to initiate navigation to either the International Student Services office (Timelapse prototype), or the Counselling Services office (Slideshow). We recorded audio and collected data throughout the journey, taking particular note of how frequently the user had to look at the device and how calm they seemed during the trip. When the user arrived to the destination, we asked them to return to the lobby without any assistance. Again at the lobby, we repeated the test using the other prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the two prototypes were tested, we had an informal discussion with them where they led the conversation and we only asked them to elaborate on personal opinions, or actions/comments made while navigating. Finally, they filled out a post-test questionnaire to complete the test session.

                <p>
                    Even though we gathered quite a bit of quantitative data in our tests, most of the more useful information was acquired from our qualitative analysis, as the users’ feedback throughout the testing process proved to be very useful in our own grasp of system deficiencies. Sometimes, the user was able to find a way to use our paper prototypes that we had not anticipated, and the benchmark tasks scoring was adjusted accordingly.

                <h3>Reactions to the general interface</h3>

                <p>
                    Most users seemed to understand the basic layout of our home screen, and were able to identify most of the key functionality, see figure below. Gerenal comments about the interface was that it was nice, easy to understand, and gave a good overview, though there were also some negative comments, describing the interface as overwhelming. Several subjects mentioned that it was not clear exactly what would happen when they pressed the buttons on the home screen,
                    and one subject noted that it was strange how the "events" is so close to the wheelchair and bathroom icons, asking what these things actually have in common.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, not all users seemed to realize that the app was for navigation - even after we had explicitly told them. Some subjects still thought that when pressing the different icons on the screen representing a student service, this would bring up information about the service, and not necessarily ways of navigating there. Furthermore, when looking for an event hosted by one of the student services, some users remarked being confused about whether they should click the name of the service, or use the search function.
                </p>


                <h4>Reactions to fast-forward video timelapse</h4>
                <p>
                    Every user we tested had the same initial reaction when trying this solution; as soon as the video started playing, they would start running to wherever the video directed them. They commented on feeling rushed, not being able to "catch up" with the video. No users stopped and watched the whole timelapse before starting to walk/run. One user simply saw that there was an elevator in the video, and ran to the nearest elevator, which did not lead to their destination. Upon rewatching the video before that elevator arrived, they were able to correct their mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virtually every test subject commented that they thought the video was going too fast. Most subjects paused the video often, and many requested more control over the way the video was presented to them. One user mentioned that they wanted the option to stop and talk with someone on the way, and then be able to resume their navigation afterwards. Some suggested segmentation of the video - for instance, that you get a video showing you how to navigate a short distance, walk, and then view a new video starting from the new location. We asked users if they would want an auto-pause feature for the video, but they did not seem to want this. One subject mentioned potentially being reluctant to start the video playback, being worried about sound coming from the phone, which would disturb others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is obvious that our desire of having users being able to navigate all the way to their destination, watching the high-speed timelapse only once, was not met. However, despite having initial negative reactions, once the subjects got used to this way of navigating, many responded favorably to the concept, saying they thought it was an efficient and fun way to navigate. One user compared it to going on a "scavenger
                    hunt", saying she would definitely use something like this for building navigation.

                <h4>Reactions to the photo slideshow</h4>
                <p>
                    Most users were very comfortable using this way of navigating. Every subject understood that the way to switch between the images was to do a "slide" gesture on the phone, and no one expressed confusion about the directions they were
                    given. A couple of the users mentioned this was a better way to navigate through the building than using a map, because it is linked to what you actually see, and is not an abstraction. Many of the subjects seemed to rely much
                    on the text beneath the pictures, in order to understand the navigation.

                <h4>General reactions</h4>
                <p>
                    In general, users seemed very pleased with our prototypes. Several users mentioned that this would be a good alternative to traditional, map-based navigation. This user satisfaction was also represented in our post-test questionnaire,
                    see figures below.

                <h3>Suggested changes</h3>
                <p>
                    We wish to try to combine our two main "modes" of the application, namely the photo slideshow and the fast-forward timelapse video. As many users seemed to like the video concept, but felt that our current implementation made them feel rushed, we want
                    to try dividing the navigation video timelapse into different segments, only leading the user part of the way to the destination, possibly to some sort of identifiable "landmark". After reaching this temporary destination, the
                    user would get a new timelapse video, showing the navigation to another temporary point, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we feel like we need to refine our system interface, especailly making it clear that it is used for navigation, and not for giving information about the different building facilities and services. Most users thought the wheelchair icon on
                    the home page would show them accessibility information for the building, while we meant it as a way to initiate wheelchair-friendly navigation. We will therefore move this icon to be a prompt before, or a toggle option during,
                    the navigation itself.
